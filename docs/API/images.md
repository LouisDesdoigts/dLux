# Images: `images.py`

This module contains the classes that define the behaviour of images in âˆ‚Lux.

There is only a single public class:

- `Image`

This class has two attributes:

- `image`
- `pixel_scale`

The `image` attribute is a 2D array of the image. The `pixel_scale` is the pixel scale of the image, the units of which depends on the `Optics` used.

[Comment]: <> (it doesn't actually say what the standard arithmetic operators do)
The `Image` class has a number of methods that allow for image manipulation. They are implemented as standard arithmetic operators, i.e.:

```python
import jax.numpy as np
import dLux as dl

image = dl.Image(np.ones((256, 256)), 0.1)
image *= 2
image += 1
image /= 2
```
[Comment]: <> (it doesn't say HOW to implement these other methods)
On top of these, it implements a number of methods that allow for the manipulation of the image, these are:

### `Downsample`

Downsamples the image by a factor of $n$. This is done by summing the image pixels in $n \times n$ blocks.

### `Convolve`

Convolves the image with another. This is done using the `jax.scipy.signal.convolve` function.

### `Rotate`

Rotates the image by a given angle. This is done using interpolation methods.
