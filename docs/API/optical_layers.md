# Optical Layers: `optical_layers.py`

This module contains the classes that define the behaviour of OpticalLayers in âˆ‚Lux.

These classes provide a simple set of classes used to perform basic transformations on wavefronts.

There are seven public classes:

- `Optic`
- `PhaseOptic`
- `BasisOptic`
- `PhaseBasisOptic`
- `Tilt`
- `Normalise`
- `Rotate`

The _optic_ classes (`Optic`, `PhaseOptic`, `BasisOptic`, `PhaseBasisOptic`) are quite general and are used to perform basic modifications to the wavefront amplitude and phase. They all have `transmission` and `normalise` attributes that modify the amplitude of the wavefront. It is optional to normalise the wavefront after it passes through the optic.

The `Optic` class holds a static OPD array that is added to the wavefront. The `PhaseOptic` class holds a static phase array that is added to the wavefront.

The `BasisOptic` class holds a set of basis vectors and coefficients that are used to calculate the OPD array that is added to the wavefront. The `PhaseBasisOptic` class holds a set of basis vectors and coefficients that are used to calculate the phase array that is added to the wavefront.

The `Tilt` class tilts the wavefront by the input angles.
