# Helper Utility Functions

This module contains the leftover functions that don't fit anywhere else in the `utils` module!

## List to Dictionary

Converts a list of âˆ‚Lux objects into a regular ordered dictionary. This shouldn't need to be used by the user, but is used internally in many of the constructors.
