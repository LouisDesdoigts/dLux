<!-- # Utilities Module

The utilities module contains a number of useful functions that are used throughout the package. It is split into 8 sub-modules: `optics`, `models`, `units`, `math`, `coordinates`, `interpolation`, `bayes`, `helpers`.

---

## Optics Module

The optics module contains a number of common equations used in optics, such as converting between OPDs and phases, and a few functions used to calcualte sampling rates in focal planes.

---

## Models Module

The models module contains a few functions that can generate pre-built optical models.

---

## Units Module

The units module contains functions for converting scales of cartesian and angular coordinates, and for converting between the different angular units.

---

## Math Module

This module only contains a single function used to calcluate factorials differentiably.

---

## Coordinates Module

This module contains a series of functions that are used to calculate coordinates arrays, apply transformations to coordinate those arrays, and convert between cartesian and polar coordiantes.

---

## Interpolation Module

This module contains some basic interpolation functions that can be used on arrays and wavefronts.

---

## Bayes Module

This module contains a few likelihood functions. plus functions to calcualte things like covariance matrices and its entropy. This module is likely to be moved in the base package of dLux, [Zodiax](https://github.com/LouisDesdoigts/zodiax).

---

## Helpers Module

This module contains any other remaining functions that don't fit into the above scripts! -->
