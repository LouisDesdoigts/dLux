# Propagators: `propagators.py`

This module contains the classes that define the behaviour of propagator layers in âˆ‚Lux.

These classes do not implement the propagation functionality themselves, but instead store the parameters of the propagation and call inbuilt methods of the `Wavefront` class; thus, its API is essentially a mirror of those methods.

There are four public classes:

- `MFT`
- `FFT`
- `ShiftedMFT`
- `FarFieldFresnel`

### `MFT(npixels, pixel_scale, focal_length=None, inverse=False)`

Performs a Matrix Fourier Transform (MFT) on the wavefront, propagating from Pupil to Focal plane. If `focal_length` is `None`, `pixel_scale` is assumed to be in angular units (radians), otherwise it is assumed to be in Cartesian units (metres).

### `FFT(pad, focal_length=None, inverse=False)`

Performs a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) on the wavefront, propagating from Pupil to Focal plane. If `focal_length` is `None`, the output units will angular (radians), otherwise cartesian (metres).

    ::: dLux.propagators.FFT

### `shiftedMFT(npixels, pixel_scale, shift, focal_length=None, pixel=True, inverse=False)`

Performs a Matrix Fourier Transform (MFT) on the wavefront, propagating from Pupil to Focal plane. If `focal_length` is `None`, `pixel_scale` is assumed to be in angular units (radians), otherwise it is assumed to be in Cartesian units (metres). The `shift` parameter is used to shift the center of the output plane, which is treated in units of pixels by default, otherwise it is treated in the units of `pixel_scale`.

    ::: dLux.propagators.ShiftedMFT

### `FarFieldFresnel(npixels, pixel_scale, focal_length, focal_shift, shift, pixel=True)`

Performs a Fresnel propagation on the wavefront, propagating from Pupil to Focal plane. The `focal_shift` parameter represents the distance from the focal plane at which the PSF is modelled. The `shift` parameter is used to shift the center of the output plane, which is treated in units of pixels by default, otherwise it is treated in the units of `pixel_scale`.
