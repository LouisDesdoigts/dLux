    "## History\n",
    "\n",
    "∂Lux is a full from-scratch rewrite of the ideas [morphine](https://github.com/benjaminpope/morphine), which is a fork of the popular optical simulation package '[poppy](https://github.com/mperrin/poppy)' using the autodiff library [Google Jax](https://github.com/google/jax) to do _derivatives_. We have built it from the ground up in [equinox](https://github.com/patrick-kidger/equinox), a powerful object-oriented library in Jax, to best take advantage of new features and permit easy development and integration with neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of ∂Lux is to facilitate a paradaigm shift in the way in which optical modelling is approached. The mathematical and structural symmetry betweeen neural networks and optical systems allows for optical modelling to done with Machine Learning libraries that can take advatange of the massively powerful tools driving the modern ML revolution. By constructing differentiable optical models that harness the power of automatic differention in the ∂Lux framework allows entirely novel ways of approach conventianlly difficult problems!\n",
    "\n",
    "For the uninitiated, automatic differentaion (auto-diff) is the mathematical tool that underpins the revolution in machine learning. The power of auto-diff ultimately lies in its ability to divorce the time it takes to optimise a model from the number of parameters being optimised in that model. This represents a *fundamental paradigm shift* in the way in which problems can be approached. Much time and effort has been focused in the past on making problems in optical modelling computationally tracatable, forcing compromises on what is learnt. This is no longer the case, directly optimising physics-based forwards models with millions of parameters is not only possible, but practical without requiring vast computation power. \n",
    "\n",
    "We have built ∂Lux using Jax - googles numpy-like auto-diff library and Equinox. Together these two packages allow us to build an optical simulator that takes full advantage of the bleeding edge of computer science. For example each individual PSF calcualtion is natively performed in parallel across however many computational resources are available without any work from the end-user. Similarly these models can be compiled at run time into XLA without. \n",
    "\n",
    "TBC...\n",
    "\n",
    "∂Lux is a optical simulation framework that is designed to allow the construction of fully-differentiable optical models that can be optimised using automatic differention (auto-diff). Why does that matter? Auto-diff is the mathematics that allows for extremely complex models with billions of parameters to be optimised efficiently - its what allows the machine to 'learn'. By construcing differentible optical models we can massively increase their complexity and train these models in the same way, with the same tools as a neural network. This represents a paradigm shift in the way in which we can approach a diverse range of optical problems from everything from signal recovery to optical architecture. A large focus of this work has been on flexibility. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "∂Lux is built primarily from [Jax](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) & [Equinox](https://docs.kidger.site/equinox/). Jax is googles numpy-like auto-diff library and Equinox is a new package that allows python classes to be registered in Jax as a PyTree, a data type that it works with natively. This allows us to write highly flexible object-oriented optical models with a numpy-like API that is natively differentiable. Furthrmore we can take advantage of industry leading tools such as [Optax](https://optax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) the optimisation library used and maintained by the Google DeepMind team. \n",

    "## Package Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "∂Lux has been built to be as simple and easy as possible for end-users, without abstracting them away from the underlying control-flow of the computations. The goal of this package is NOT to be a collection of optical modelling algorithms, but to be a FRAMEWORK that allows for easy construction of natively differentiably optical models in a robust way. With this goal we have focused heavily on flexibility, readability and constructing code to be natively differentiable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Its structure is designed around the idea that optical systems operate in a mathematically analgous way to neural networks. \n",
    "<!--  A Neural network maps some input perform a seires of linear transformations and array opterations on some input vector through a series of layers. and optical systems transform some input wavefront using a series of optical surfaces and mirrors.  -->\n",
    "In the same way that neural networks are constructed from layers, we represent our optical train as a linear list of operations performed on some input wavefront, also called layers. \n",
    "\n",
    "∂Lux functions using three classes:\n",
    " 1. Layers\n",
    " 2. `Wavefront()`\n",
    " 3. `Optical System()`\n",
    "    \n",
    "The `OpticalSystem` class holds a list of Layers which define the operations performed on the input `Wavefront()` via the optical train, and passes the `Wavefront` object between those layers. We have already built a series of generic Layers that should allow users to simulate most optical systems, contained in two scirpts:\n",
    " 1. `src/layers.py`\n",
    " 2. `src/propagators.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "With `layers.py` containing the classes to perform transformation operations on the wavefront (modify phase, amplitude, interpolate) and `propagators.py` containing the classes used to propagate that wavefront through the optical train.\n",
    "\n",
    "- \n",
    "\n",
    "As open open source software we also encourage users to [build thier own custom Layer classes](tutorial_link_goes_here.com) and integrate them into ∂Lux!\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main types of classes that form the foundation of ∂Lux, the `OpticalSystem()` and the layers. In order to construct a model of an optical system one simply defines the series of operations/transforms that is performed on the input wavefront in a list, which is passed as an argument to the `OpticalSystem()` class. Each transformation or operation is a single 'layer' in that list. For a very simple optical a typical list of layers would look something like this:\n",

    "```\n",
    "layers = [\n",

    "  TiltWavefront(),\n",
    "  CircualrAperture(wf_npix),\n",

    "  MFT(det_npix, fl, det_pixsize)\n",
    "]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This list of layers can then be turned into an optical system -> `OpticalSystem(layers)`. We now have a fully differentiable optical model!\n",
