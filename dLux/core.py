    Parameters
    ----------

    scene : Scene = None
        The scene to observe.
    sources : Union[dict, list) = None
        The sources to observe.
    source : dLux.sources.Source = None
        The source to observe.
    normalise : bool = None
        Whether to normalise the sources before modelling. Default is True.
    flatten : bool = False
        Whether the output image should be flattened. Default is False.
    return_tree : bool = False
        Whether to return a Pytree like object with matching tree structure as
        the input scene/sources/source. Default is False.

    Returns
    -------
    image : Array, Pytree
        The image of the scene modelled through the optics with detector and
        filter effects applied if they are supplied. Returns either as a single

    Attributes
    ----------
    layers: list, required
        - A list of layers that defines the tranformaitons and operations of the system (typically optical)
    wavels: ndarray
        - An array of wavelengths in meters to simulate
        - The shape must be 1d - stellar spectrums are controlled through the weights parameter
        - No default value is set if not provided and this will throw an error if you try to call functions that depend on this parameter
        - It is left as optional so that functions that allow wavelength input can be called on objects without having to pre-input wavelengths
    positions: ndarray, optional
        - An array of (x,y) stellar positions in units of radians, measured as deviation of the optical axis. 
        - Its input shape should be (Nstars, 2), defining an x, y position for each star. 
        - If not provided, the value defaults to (0, 0) - on axis
    fluxes: ndarray, optional
        - An array of stellar fluxes, its length must match the positions inputs size to work properly
        - Theoretically this has arbitrary units, but we think of it as photons
        - Defaults to 1 (ie, returning a unitary flux psf if not specified)
    weights: ndarray, optional
        - An array of stellar spectral weights (arb units)
        - This can take multiple shapes
        - Default is to weight all wavelengths equally (top-hat)
        - If a 1d array is provided this is applied to all stars, shape (Nwavels)
        - if a 2d array is provided each is applied to each individual star, shape (Nstars, Nwavels)
        - Note the inputs values are always normalised and will not directly change total output flux (inderectly it can change it by weighting more flux to wavelengths with more aperture losses, for example)
    dithers: ndarray, optional
        - An arary of (x, y) positional dithers in units of radians
        - Its input shape should be (Nims, 2), defining the (x,y) dither for each image
        - if not provided, defualts to no-dither
    detector_layers: list, optional
        - A second list of layer objects designed to allow processing of psfs, rather than wavefronts
        - It is applied to each image after psfs have been approraitely weighted and summed
