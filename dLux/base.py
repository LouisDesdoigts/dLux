    """ Optical System class, Equinox Modle
    
    DOCSTRING NOT COMPLETE
    
    A Class to store and apply properties external to the optical system
    Ie: stellar positions and spectra
    
    positions: (Nstars, 2) array
    wavels: (Nwavels) array
    weights: (Nwavel)/(Nwavels, Nstars) array
    
    dLux currently does not check that inputs are correctly shaped/formatted!

    Notes:
     - Take in layers in order to re-intialise the model every call?
    
    General images output shape: (Nimages, Nstars, Nwavels, Npix, Npix)
    
     - Currently doesnt allow temporal variation in spectrum 
     - Currently doesnt allow temporal variation in flux
    
    ToDo: Add getter methods for accessing weights and fluxes attributes that
    use np.squeeze to remove empy axes

    
    Attributes
    ----------
    layers: list, required
        - A list of layers that defines the tranformaitons and operations of the system (typically optical)
     
    wavels: ndarray
        - An array of wavelengths in meters to simulate
        - The shape must be 1d - stellar spectrums are controlled through the weights parameter
        - No default value is set if not provided and this will throw an error if you try to call functions that depend on this parameter
        - It is left as optional so that functions that allow wavelength input can be called on objects without having to pre-input wavelengths
    positions: ndarray, optional
        - An array of (x,y) stellar positions in units of radians, measured as deviation of the optical axis. 
        - Its input shape should be (Nstars, 2), defining an x, y position for each star. 
        - If not provided, the value defaults to (0, 0) - on axis
    fluxes: ndarray, optional
        - An array of stellar fluxes, its length must match the positions inputs size to work properly
        - Theoretically this has arbitrary units, but we think of it as photons
        - Defaults to 1 (ie, returning a unitary flux psf if not specified)
    weights: ndarray, optional
        - An array of stellar spectral weights (arb units)
        - This can take multiple shapes
        - Default is to weight all wavelengths equally (top-hat)
        - If a 1d array is provided this is applied to all stars, shape (Nwavels)
        - if a 2d array is provided each is applied to each individual star, shape (Nstars, Nwavels)
        - Note the inputs values are always normalised and will not directly change total output flux (inderectly it can change it by weighting more flux to wavelengths with more aperture losses, for example)
    dithers: ndarray, optional
        - An arary of (x, y) positional dithers in units of radians
        - Its input shape should be (Nims, 2), defining the (x,y) dither for each image
        - if not provided, defualts to no-dither
    detector_layers: list, optional
        - A second list of layer objects designed to allow processing of psfs, rather than wavefronts
        - It is applied to each image after psfs have been approraitely weighted and summed
