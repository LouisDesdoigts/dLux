## Installation

∂Lux is continuously being developed. For that reason we suggest cloning the development version from source:

To install from source: clone this git repo, enter the directory, and run

```
pip install .
```
You can also install from PyPI, but this version will be subject to change.

To install from PyPI run

```
pip install dLux
```


## Windows/Google Colab Quickstart
`jaxlib` can be problematic on windows so we suggest users run our software on [Google Colab](https://research.google.com/colaboratory/).
There are a few extra steps to get setup
1. At the top of each colab file you will need 
``` 
!git clone https://github.com/LouisDesdoigts/dLux.git # Download latest version
!cd dLux; pip install . -q # Navigate to ∂Lux and install from source
``` 


## Use

Documentation can be found at [louisdesdoigts.github.io/dLux](https://louisdesdoigts.github.io/dLux/), and is under continuous development.


## Collaboration & Development

We are always looking to collaborate and further develop this software! We have focused on flexibility and ease of development, so if you have a project you want to use ∂Lux for, but it currently does not have the required capabilities, don't hesitate to email me and we can discuss how to implement and merge it! louis.desdoigts@sydney.edu.au
