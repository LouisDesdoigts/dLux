## Installation

∂Lux is continuously being developed. For that reason we suggest cloning from source:

To install from source: clone this git repo, enter the directory, and run

>
>`pip install .`

You can also install from PyPI, but this version is updated less often.

To install from PyPI run

>
>`pip install dLux`


## Use

Documentation can be found at [louisdesdoigts.github.io/dLux](https://louisdesdoigts.github.io/dLux/). Note the docs are mostly built but the package is continually being developed so they are subject to change!

We are currently building tutorial notebooks to help new users get started! We do have some demonstration notebooks that can be found [here!](https://github.com/LouisDesdoigts/dLux/tree/main/notebooks). These notebooks are designed to get users started with a few different uses cases of ∂Lux and its tool. 

> Note: You must first run the `basis_creation.ipynb` notebook to generate and save files that are used in the other notebooks. Then `GE_optimisation.ipynb` must be run to generate a pupil for use in all of the other notebooks.
