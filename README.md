## Installation

The easiest way to install is from PyPI: just use

`pip install dLux`

To install from source: clone this git repo, enter the directory, and run

`python setup.py install`

## Use

We are currently building examples and documentation! For now - see a [simple example](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Dz5NdRhtbGOzPl7jlIn5JvwNEQfaOq9Y?usp=sharing) in Google colab showing deployment onto GPU.

## History

∂Lux is a full from-scratch rewrite of the ideas [morphine](https://github.com/benjaminpope/morphine) which is a fork of the popular optical simulation package '[poppy](https://github.com/mperrin/poppy)' using the autodiff library [Google Jax](https://github.com/google/jax) to do _derivatives_.
